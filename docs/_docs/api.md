The APIGateway API currently 'works' but could/should be a lot better. For example, it should have a Swagger spec to provide documentation and automatic client generation in multiple languages, making it easy for anyone to incorporate the bookings service into their own app. I'd also like the API to support IFTTT so players could e.g. sign themselves up to receive notifications about last-minute cancellations etc.
