Sqawsh is a toy project to test drive [AWS microservices](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/microservices-without-the-servers/) - implementing a basic serverless squash court booking service. You can follow the [simple instructions]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/deployment.md %}) to create your own booking service(s) - or experiment with [one I created earlier]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/demo.md %}) - please feel free to make some bookings. The code itself is documented in the Javadocs.
